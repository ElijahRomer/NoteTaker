## Usage

Using this application is relatively straightforward. When the URL is first visited, there will be a landing page for navigating to the notes section. This will bring you to the note interface where you can read, add, and delete your notes.

### Reading a Note

To read a note, the user need only click the title in the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. This will open the note and its contents on the right hand side.

### Adding a note

To add a note, the user must click the plus ( + ) icon in the top right hand corner of the screen. This will open a blank note, and allow you to enter a title and text for the note. When finished, click the save icon ( floppy disk ) in the top right hand corner of the screen. This will write the note to the database and persist the note upon subsequent browser sessions.

**Please note, you must include both a title and text on the note in order to save it.**

### Deleting a note

To delete a note, the user clicks the red garbage icon next to the title of said note on the sidebar to the left. This will remove the note from the database, and refresh the results.
